Steps:
(Assuming git is installed in the computer)

1). Write git init
2). Then make a file .gitignore in the main project folder.

What is .gitignore: .gitignore is a file of plain text where each line contains a file names to ignore means the file which we don't want to add in the github repo will be added in the .gitignore file such as: node modules etc.

3). Write git add . (This will add files to the local computer)
4). git commit -m "commit message"

Till here from our local computer all work is done.

Now go to github account , make a repository and copy repo path.

5). Now type , git remote add origin <RepoPath>

Now we can simply push the code after it , but we want SSH key connection for pushing to get a secure channel in it.

6). Type  ls ~/.ssh in gitbash.

If the output is ls: cannot access '/c/Users/Nexgen/.ssh': No such file or directory , Then follow me.

7). Type ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "yourGithubEmail@abc.com" (This command will generate ssh key for you).

After it , it will ask for file path just press enter , then it ask for passphrase(password) simple press enter and again enter.

8). Type ls ~/.ssh this command again. (It will show you 2 keys , id_rsa(which is private key) id_rsa.pub(Which is public key)

9). Now we have to add private key in our system. For this type. eval $(ssh-agent -s) Output: Agent pid <someId>

10). Now type this command ,  ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa , Now this will add your private ssh key to your local computer and is ready to use.

11). Now we have to add public key to github , go to github profile , then settings , then SSH and GPG key , Then click add new key , then add any title you want
     
12). Now in the key section you have to give key code , which will generated by this command: cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub , enter and copy the whole code and paste in key section.

13). Now click on "Add SSH key" and your key is successfully been added.

14). Now to confirm secure connection between local computer and github type command: ssh -T git@github.com 

If you get this message: Hi AsadKhan911! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access. (Then all set)

Else if you get this message: The authenticity of host 'github.com (20.207.73.82)' can't be established.  
ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:p2QAMXNIC1TJYWeIOttrVc98/R1BUFWu3/LiyKgUfQM.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? ...... Just Type yes and enter the issue will be resolved.

15). Now type: git branch , if it is master then Type (git push -u origin master) if it is main type (git push -u origin main).

Now the all code will be transferred to the Github repo. :)))))))))))

IN FUTURE IF YOU CHANGE ANYTHING IN YOUR REPO:

TYPE:

git add .
git commit -m "msg"
git push

And the code will be updated.
