What is error 404 page: Suppose we have multiple routes for our pages eg: /about , /contact etc but if user searches the page /abcd which is not available, the UI will show the user an error which is not visually attractive or understandable which will cause the user experience bad aswell SEO.

For this instance we create a seperate view in views folder 404.hbs in which we decently described the cause of error.

app.get('/about', (req, res) => {
    res.render('about'); // No need for '.hbs'
});

app.get('/contact', (req, res) => {
    res.render('contact'); // No need for '.hbs'
});

index.hbs:
<body>
    <h1 style="color: red;">CANNOT FOUND THE PAGE {{page}}</h1>
</body>

index.js:
app.get('*' , (req,res)=>{ //Remember this will be on the last of all routes even the one described below after it /about/*
    res.render('404' , {
	page : req.url})
})

The last '*' route is for error:404 page , this means the routes other than available routes will be run by this '*' by the server.
If contact,about,home are available if user search /services the server will redirect this route to '*' because it is other than the available.
It will only access these routes such as: http://localhost:8000/shndhsbd

But what if user searches: http://localhost:8000/about/abcd , means about k ander ja kr agar wo kch glt likhe to server ko ye kese pta chle ga.
index.hbs:
<body>
    <h1 style="color: red;">CANNOT FOUND THE PAGE {{page}}</h1>
</body>

index.js
app.get('/about/*' , (req,res)=>{
    res.render('404' , {
        page : req.url
    })
})

For this we will do this , simply
