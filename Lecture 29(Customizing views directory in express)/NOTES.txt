In previous lecture we learned about template engines.

But the issue is that we have to add the files in a directory named views and we can't change the folder name.

In this lecture we will see how can we can use the folder name of our own choice and can access the hbs files easily.

For this we have to just add one line: 

const express = require('express')
const app = express()
const path = require('path')

const hbsPath = path.join(__dirname , '/nameChanged') //First of all we have to extract the folder path which name is been changed from views to any other name
//Set view engine
app.set('view engine' , 'hbs')

app.set('views' , hbsPath) //After setting view engine we have to give first argument views, second is folde path we extract , now we can access all the files.

//Set template engine route
app.get('/' , (req,res)=> {
    res.render('index.hbs')
})

app.listen(8000 , ()=>{
    console.log("Port Running at 8000")
})
