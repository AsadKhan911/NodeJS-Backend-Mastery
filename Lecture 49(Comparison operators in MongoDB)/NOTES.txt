Following are the comparsion operators of mongoDB:

$eq: Equal to

$ne: Not equal to

$gt: Greater than

$gte: Greater than or equal to

$lt: Less than

$lte: Less than or equal to

$in: In an array of values

{ field: { $in: [value1, value2, ...] } } //this will take array of input , if any of the one exists in it , it shows those documents.

$nin: Not in an array of values

{ field: { $nin: [value1, value2, ...] } } //this will take array of input , if any of the one exists in it , it shows those documents except from one that matches.

HOW TO USE THEM? //Very easy

const result = await TestModel.find({age:{$gt : 20}}) //age is the field(attribute) name.
