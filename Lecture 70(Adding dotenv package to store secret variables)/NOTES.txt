What is dotenv?

Dotenv is a npm package that helps us to store secure material(variables) in a seperate file .env and we can access those variables by requiring that file in our desired file where we want to use those variables.

HOW TO USE IT?
1. Install package 'npm i dotenv' in the directory where your package.json() file is.

2. Secondly create a file name only .env(nothing before nothing after just .env) in your root directory of your project.

3. Add any data into the .env file eg: SECRET_KEY = abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz

4. Require env file. require('dotenv').config() , this must be at the very top of your file for a good practice. we use .config() because this method loads the variables from .env file and can be accessible in our desired file through this method.

5. Add this variable by adding process.env before any variable eg: const token = await jwt.sign({_id:this._id} , process.env.SECRET_KEY)
