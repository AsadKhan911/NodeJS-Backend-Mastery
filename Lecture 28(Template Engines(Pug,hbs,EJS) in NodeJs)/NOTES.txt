What is template engine in NodeJs: 

In Node.js, a template engine is a tool that helps you create HTML pages dynamically. Instead of writing static HTML, you use a template engine to insert data into your HTML templates.

Hereâ€™s how it works in simple terms:

Templates: You create HTML files with placeholders where you want dynamic data to appear. These placeholders are replaced with actual data when the page is rendered.

Data: When a request comes in, your Node.js app fetches or generates the data you need to display.

Rendering: The template engine takes the HTML template and the data, combines them, and produces the final HTML that is sent to the user's browser.

How to use hbs:

1). Create a directory(folder) named 'views' in the main folder of your project.

2). Now create a file in views folder with .hbs extension.

3). Set view engine: type-> app.set('view engine' , 'hbs') //now the view engine is setted.

4). Set the view enigne route: It is same just like we set routes for express app with app.get , the main difference is we use res.render() instead of res.send()

app.get('/' , (req,res)=> {
    res.render('index.hbs') //means now we can send a whole file to show dynamic content such as home file seperate, contact file seperate etc.
})

How to send dynamic data?

HBS file: <body>
    <h1>This is the dynamic dataaaaaaaa of {{DataName}}</h1>
</body>

index.js: app.get('/' , (req,res)=> {
    res.render('index.hbs' , {
        DataName : "EJ"
    })
})

This is just like props in react we do. Name must be same on both sides eg DataName.
