CRUD OPERATION:

1). CREATE
2). READ
3). UPDATE
4). DELETE

In previous lecture we cover the Create of CRUD in which we learn how to create collection and create documents inside the collections.

In this lecture we will cover the Read of CRUD in which we learn how to read the documents inside our collections.

1). db.<collectionName>.find(): Find all the results of the given collection.

2). db.appdata.find().pretty() :Show the result in pretty format.

3). db.appdata.find({name:"Reactjs"}): Get only mongoDB data as output. The key value pair we provided in bracket is know as query. (REMEMBER it is case sensitive). It

 will show only those documents which are having this key value pair name:'Reactjs'

4). db.appdata.find({name:"Reactjs"}, {name:1}): This will show only field with attribute name:'Reactjs' with only field name. If we use name:0 it will show all 

fields except name field. And this extra bracket name is projection.

5). db.appdata.find({name:"Reactjs"}, {_id:0,name:1}): As we know when we use name:1 it only shows name but also a unique id which must shows. But if we also want to 

hide id and only displays name field then we will use this command. 0 means hide , 1 means show.

6). db.appdata.find({name:"Reactjs"}).limit(1): This will only shows the very first document which is being matched among all. Set the limit value accordingly.

7).  db.appdata.find({name:"Reactjs"}).limit(1).skip(1): This will skip the first one and show the second one with name:'reactjs' you can skip(2) if you want to show 

3rd document and vice versa.
