We can simply do custom validation in schemas like this:

age: {
    type: Number,
    required: true, 
    validate(value) { //Value will be that value which user pass as an age , it can be any name but value will be more good.
      				
     return value >= 18;	// Custom validation: age must be at least 18
    }
  }
