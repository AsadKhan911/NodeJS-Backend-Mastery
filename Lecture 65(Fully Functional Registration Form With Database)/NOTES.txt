In this lecture we learned how to connect our html page with express and store the data in mongodb:

As we do in postman all things are same just the differences are below:

1). In form you must mention action="/signup" method="POST" etc. when the submit button hit the form will take action='/signup' and visit the route /signup in express.
2). The submit button must have the type=submit.
3). Every input field must contains name= attribute , the value in name attribute will use in express to get the value of that input field.
4). app.use(express.json())
app.use(express.urlencoded({extended:false})) Write these two things in express to get the data from html page in json format.

5). When storing data in the database , store like this:

const submitFormData = new regModel({
                firstname : req.body.firstname,
                lastname : req.body.lastname,
                gender : req.body.inlineRadioOptions,
                email : req.body.email,
                phone : req.body.phone,
                age :   req.body.age,
                password : password, //or req.body.password if html input name and schema key name is same use can just write like this
                confirmpassword : req.body.cpassword
            })
            const saveData = await submitFormData.save()

the key is the schema field key, and the req.body.firstname is the input name field.

-> If both the schema key and input name attribute are same we can like this:

EG: schema -> firstname : type:String
    <input type=text name=firstname/>

firstname:firstname
OR
we can just write firstname while inserting data in database.
It will convert from: firstname : req.body.firstname TO firstname. OR firstname:firstname
