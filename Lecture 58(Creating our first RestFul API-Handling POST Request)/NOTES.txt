To create a RESTFUL API first of all structure you project folders like this:

1). Create a root folder.
2). Create a src folder.
3). Inside src create one file name app.js or index.js
4). Inside src create one folder named db for your database and inside that 'db folder' create a file named conn.js (to create a mongo connection).
5). Inside src create one folder named models in which you have all your models for your database.

app.use(express.json())
It parses incoming JSON payloads and makes the resulting object available on req.body. Without this middleware, JSON request bodies would be unreadable by your Express application.

Must use this when you are sending a post JSON data.

app.post('/students' , (req,res) =>{

    console.log(req.body)
    const user = new StudentModel(req.body) //we can get the data using req.body instead we write inputs manually and save as we do. Now we can do dynamically by 					      req.body, means user jo b data dal k enter krega ham usko req.body k through access krlengy. Till now it is stored in 					      local machine but no in database.
    user.save() //now it will store in database aswell.
})
