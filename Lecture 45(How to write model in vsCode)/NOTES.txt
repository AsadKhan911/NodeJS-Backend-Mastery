Code in last lecture.

Conditions:

1). Suppose you have no collection(table) in your database and you make a model:

const TestModel = new mongoose.model('TestCollection' , testSchema)

->In this the first parameter will automatically change to lowercase 'testcollection' + pluralize it 'testcollections' and make a new collection in your database when the first document will be inserted using this schema and model.

-> The second parameter is schema name which you want to attach with this model.

2). Suppose you already have a collection in your database and you want to connect model with that collection:

const TestModel = mongoose.model('TestModel', testSchema, 'TestCollection');

->In this the first parameter will be your model name for reference only,(apny dekhne k lie bas), second parameter is Schema to be connected and the third parameter will be the collection(table) name which exists in mongoDB , remember the third parameter is case-sensitive , and now the model will connect to that collection.

WHOLE CODE INCLUDING SCHEMA FOR IT:

const mongoose = require('mongoose');

// Define the schema
const testSchema = new mongoose.Schema({ //Good practice to write schema name in camelCase.
  name: String,
  age: Number
});

// Create the model
const TestModel = mongoose.model('TestModel', testSchema, 'TestCollection'); Good practice to write model name in UpperCamelCase
