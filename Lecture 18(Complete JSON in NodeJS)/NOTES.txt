Key interview points:

-> JSON stands for javaScript Object Notation.
-> JSON  is ia light weight format for storing and trasnporting data.
-> JSON is often used when data is sent from a server to a web page.

How to make a simple object?

const myObj = {
name : 'Asad',
age : 24,
occupation : 'Student',
}

This is it , object have key value pairs in which key is without quotes and value is with quotes ''

console.log(myObj.name)
console.log(myObj.age)
console.log(myObj.occupation) We can simple call object keys or properties like this

->How to change object to JSON?

const jsonData = JSON.stringify(myObj) //JSON.stringify() is used to convert object to JSON Format
console.log(jsonData)

OUTPUT: {"name":"Asad","age":24,"occupation":"Student"} //JSON format is nothing but object which contains both key and value in double quotes thats it.

//How to change JSON into object?

const objAgain = JSON.parse(jsonData)
console.log(objAgain)

OUTPUT: { name: 'Asad', age: 24, occupation: 'Student' } 

FINAL LOOK OF DIFFERENCE BW JSON AND OBJECT:

OBJECT:
const myObj = {
    name : 'Asad',
    age : 24,
    occupation : 'Student',
};

JSON:
{
    "name" : "Asad",
    "age" : 24,
    "occupation" : "Student"
} //The last value doesnot ends with comma aswell it doesnot stores in a variable
