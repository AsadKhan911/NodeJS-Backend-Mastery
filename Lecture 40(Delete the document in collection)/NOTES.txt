Same like update operation we can perform delete by this command:

-> For deleting the very first match of the filter:

db.appdata.deleteOne({type:"front-end-developer"})

-> For deleting all the matches of the filter:

db.appdata.deleteMany({type:"front-end-developer"})

IMP: To delete all the documents into a collection:

db.appdata.deleteOne({}) //Just type nothing and press enter all documents inside collection will be deleted.
