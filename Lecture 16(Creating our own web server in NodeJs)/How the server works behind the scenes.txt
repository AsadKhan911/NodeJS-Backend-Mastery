1. Writing and Running Your Code:

Code Creation: You write your Node.js server code in VS Code. For instance, your code might be in a file called index.js

Running the Server: You start your server by running the file using Node.js. In your terminal, you would use a command like: node index.js

2. Server Execution:

Server Startup: When you run the command, Node.js executes the code in index.js. This sets up your server to listen for incoming requests on port 8000.

Listening for Requests: Your server is now actively listening on port 8000 and the IP address 127.0.0.1 (localhost).

3. Accessing the Server:

Browser Request: When you enter localhost:8000 in Chrome, the browser sends an HTTP request to the server running on your local machine.

Request Handling: The HTTP request is directed to your Node.js server, which is listening on port 8000.

Response: Your server processes the request and sends back the response defined in your code ("Hey this server is made by Asad Khan").

4. Networking:

Localhost and Ports: localhost is a hostname that resolves to 127.0.0.1, your local machineâ€™s IP address. Port 8000 is specified to direct the request to the correct process running on your machine.
