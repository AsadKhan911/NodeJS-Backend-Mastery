What is stream?

Streams are objects that let you read data from a source or write data to a destination in continous fashion. In Nodejs.

Streaming means listening to music or watching video in 'real time' instead of downloading a file to your computer and watching it later.

Example: Youtube , Netflix , SoundCloud etc.

There are four types of streams:

//More important

1). Readable: Stream which is used for read operation.
2). Writable: Stream which is used for write operation.

//Less important, but remember

3). Duplex: Stream which can be used for both read and write operation.
4). Transform: A type of duplex stream where the output is computed based on input.

Each type of Stream is 'EventEmitter' instance and throws several events at different instance of times, eg: some of the commonly used events are-

1). data: This event is fired when there is data available to read.
2). end: This event is fired when there is no more data to read.
3). error: This event is fired when there is any error receiving or writing data.
4). finish: This event is fired when all the data has been flushed to underlying system.
