Module in NodeJS are nothing but libraries like we use in REACT with import keyword to make our work smart with predefined methods and codes.

To add module in NodeJS we will use require('') keyword as we use import in ReactJS.

There are many modules but we will discuss some core ones.

Module Names:

1). fs: The fs (file system) module in Node.js provides an API 

-> Write Files: Write data to a file, replacing the file if it already exists.

const fs = require('fs')
fs.writeFileSync('read.txt' , "Welcome to the 5th lecture") //file name , and content in the parameter.

-> fs.writeFileSync is a synchronous operation file creating and writing , while 'fs.writeFile' is Asynchoronous.
And if the file already created by same name it will write this content inside it , otherwise it will create first and then write.

-> to interact with the file system. Here are some of the key things it can do:

2). fs.appendFileSync()/fs.appendFile: It is used if we want not to override the data in a file like fs.wrtieFile , instead we want to add more in it.

3). fs.readFileSync(): Used to read the file.

//When we read a file we will get the buffer data.

let buffer_data = fs.readFileSync('read.txt')
console.log(buffer_data)

But if we want to convert buffer data to string we have to simply use .toString() method.

let str_data = buffer_data.toString()
console.log(str_data) //Simple

4). fs.renameSync('old name' , 'new name'): Use to rename the file
fs.renameSync('read.txt' , 'newName.txt')
